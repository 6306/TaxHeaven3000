Source code with ports.



CatScape Technologies and I (Skylar Clark) is not part of MSCHF (creators of Tax Heaven 3000).
Tax Heaven 3000 has been decompiled to be used in Ren'Py and be modify if a user is willing to do so.

The ports by CatScape and I (Skylar Clark) is a Web port and a Android port.
These ports are unofficial and will be taken down if MSCHF contacts me about it.
